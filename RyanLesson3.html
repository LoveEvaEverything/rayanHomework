		<img src="image.jpg">
		Legendary New Zealand architect Roger Walker is selling his striking pink and green Wellington home.

		<p>The castle-like house at 175 Grant Street, in Thorndon, is one of more than 500 buildings Walker has designed throughout his long and distinguished career. It’s also his favourite.</p>

		<p>The architect told OneRoof it’s the only house he has ever built for himself. “It was a great opportunity to express myself. I was wearing the client hat and only had to listen to myself.”</p>

		<p>Walker found the site in the late 1980s, and thought it would suit his family’s needs. “We had a house in Mount Victoria, but I wanted to build something for myself. I wanted to remain in the inner-city but there were no sites in Mount Victoria, but there was this one site on Grant Road.</p>
